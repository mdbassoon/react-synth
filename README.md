## Description

This is a polyphonic synthesizer based on the [Web Audio Api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) and built in [React](https://reactjs.org/). Includes Midi support for two octaves. Using the [Web Audio Api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API)'s analyser function, I was able to draw the full output of the audio context onto a web canvas. Play around with music and watch it happen in real time on the screen. Demo here:[http://synth.sounddev.co/](http://synth.sounddev.co/)
